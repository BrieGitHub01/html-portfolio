<h1>The Best Movies According to Brie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
<p>I love musical movie with great song and story. I love the diversities in the movie. Based on real life story but tweaked so it's more interesting.</p>
<h3>The Host</h3>
<p>The plot twist in the end really made me mad.</p>
<h3>Grave of Fireflies</h3>
<p>It's a really sad truth on what happened behind all wars. I cried so much.</p>
